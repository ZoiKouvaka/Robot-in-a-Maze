# Robot-in-a-Maze
Find minimum-cost way out of a maze using UCS and A* algorithms in java
A colab with Vasiliki Katogianni and Ioannis Tsironis
Maze: We consider a matrix with NxN cells, some of them are free, while the others contain obstacles and we can not visit them. Each cell (x,y) is labeled as free or not by deciding independently with probability p (eg p=0.1). To each free cell (x,y) we assign a number (called val(x,y)), which is randomly selected from the integers 1 to 4. Robot: If robot is in cell (x,y), then it can moves every time either horizontally, vertically or diagonally to an neighboring free cell. Î¤he program finds the path (if any) that the robot should follow starting from one starting cell (S) to reach the nearest (based on path cost) of two specific terminal G1 and G2 cells. The (x,y) coordinates of cells S, G1 and G2 are given by the user to beginning of the program. For each maze, both the UCS method and the A* methods are applied.
